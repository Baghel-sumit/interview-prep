------------- DBMS vs File Systems ------------------

File system disadvantages

1. Data redundancy & inconsistency
2. Difficulty in accessing data
3. Data Isolation
4. Integrity Problems
5. Atomicity Problems
6. Concurrent access anomalies
7. Security Problems

* Above 7 are also the advantages of DBMS ( answer to "why to use DBMS ?" )
